Now that I've Got a Model - Where's My Application?
===================================================

Congratulations! You've successfully created and generated the Myzilla model.

Now you'll want to create instances of this model and play with the generated editor.
The next tutorial step will launch a runtime workspace in which you'll have to
create a simple test project, e.g., "myzilla.testing" and use the generated
model wizard to create a new Classification instance and add children to it.

Press F5 to do so...

When you're done evaluating your model exit from the runtime workspace and continue
the tutorial in the host IDE.
